            The sea level in the world is currently rising, because lots of iceburgs are melting. This can cause lots
                of problems, such as polar bears not having a home because there is no more ice.

            <p class="card-text">
                Climate change describes how our planet's average temperate, rainfall, wind and other weather condition
                change over a long period of time.
                <br>
                <br><b>Weather</b>
                <br>The daily conditions of the atmosphere over a specific, small local area
                <br>

                <br><b>Climate</b>
                <br>The long-term weather pattern over a large region, area or the globe.
                <br>

                <br><b>Climate change</b>

                Fighting climate change doesn't have to be hard - if we all make small changes, big things can happen.
                <br>
                <br><b>Energy</b>
                <br>- Turn off lights that you don't need!
                <br>- Try and persuade your parents/carers to switch to energy saving LED bulbs
                <br>

                <br><b>Transport</b>
                <br>- Walk or cycle when possible, it's great for the planet, mind and body
                <br>

                <br><b>Diet</b>
                <br>- Eat more vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts and seeds
                <br>- Eat less meat and dairy (try meat-free Mondays)
                <br>
                <br><b>Reduce, reuse, repair, recycle!</b>
                <br>- Recycling is actually the last possible action you should take. It isn't perfect.
                <br>- Before recycling, try and get as much use out of it as possible!
